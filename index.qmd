**THIS VERSION IS A DRAFT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO REVIEWERS ONLY. **


While being a reference work, this book also chronicles the amazing story of the growth and accomplishments of the SCUC-ISD over the past 28 years.  More than 152 charts visually illustrate the steady improvement of students, teachers, administration and facilities even as successive challenges arose.  The demographics of the district changed; the legislative environment changed; the district continues to become stronger.

Over the 28-year span, successive boards and superintendents navigated myriad challenges while raising most standardized scores, addressing staffing needs, and constructing new schools all while maintaining favorable student-teacher ratios, balancing administrative costs with instructional resources, and building adequate financial reserves.  All without the so-called 'good governance' rubrik so popular in today's academic circles.

A note about the accompanying run charts.  A run chart is a simple plot of observations (results of some process) sequentially over time.  The longer the time plotted the more informative the plot becomes.  They are the starting point to gain predictive insight into instructional and administrative practices.

The centerline is the median; the point where half the points lie above the line and half below it.  It is not the average, and except under specific circumstances it is not a predictor of future results.  It simply helps your eye understand the overall shape of the results.  Sometimes Upward is the 'good' direction, sometimes Downward is the 'good' direction.  Decide which direction is 'good' for any metric and see how the district has fared in that area.

In case you're worried about understanding run charts, here's a photo of a run chart created by 4th graders at Leander ISD with magic markers and newsprint.  This simple chart enabled students to dramatically reduce the number of 'loss of control' incidents during the day.  The chart tells this story simply, and clearly.

If 4th graders can do it; so can we all!
