# Preface {.unnumbered}


**THIS VERSION IS A DRAFT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO REVIEWERS ONLY. **


This book tells the amazing story of the growth and accomplishments of the SCUC-ISD over the past 28 years, as illustrated through 152 run charts.

There are 4,255 observations covering 28 years summarized in the compiled plots.

A run chart is a simple plot of observations (results of some process) sequentially over time.  The longer the time plotted the more informative the plot becomes.

The centerline is the median; the point where half the points lie above the line and half below it.  It is not the average, nor a prediction of future results.  It simply helps your eye understand the overall shape of the results.  Sometimes Upward is the 'good' direction, sometimes Downward.

In case you're worried about understanding run charts, here's a photo of a run chart created by 4th graders at Leander ISD with magic markers and newsprint.  This simple chart enabled students to dramatically reduce the number of 'loss of control' incidents during the day.  The chart tells this story simply, and clearly.

If 4th graders can do it; so can we!
