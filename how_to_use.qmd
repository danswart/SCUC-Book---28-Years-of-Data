# How to Use This Book {.unnumbered}


I felt compelled to make this information available to our district.  It's the only way to justify the obscene amount of time required to wrangle the data from the TEA website and compile that data into plots that are useful for planning and governance.

The charts are the starting point for defining goals and improvement efforts that have practical meaning - not the jargon or euphemisms that are currently en vogue.  

Each chart tells a real story about real things.  Taken together they tell a story of how one school district met the challenges successive school boards faced.  The time frames involved provide the context needed to understand the outputs of the systems of learning in our District.

All categories and definitions are those of the Texas Education Agency and not of the author.

There are a LOT of charts contained in these chapters.  I suggest that you browse the Table of Contents and start with a chapter, or topic, you are particularly interested in and move outward from there.  To view them in order might invite a nap!

Some may be interested in scholastic performance, some in financial performance, some in general demographic information, some in budgetary matters.

The Table of Contents has links to the various chapters.  Once you are in a Chapter, the sidebar on the right side has links to the various charts within the chapter.

Nearly all the plots are run charts.  The exact numbers are not as important as gaining the overall range of values and any trends present in the measurements.  Is it trending up, down, or stable at a given level?  Is an upward trend good news, or bad?

Once you find a chart, or group of charts, that represent an area you feel might be important for district improvement further analysis and study can guide you more precisely.
